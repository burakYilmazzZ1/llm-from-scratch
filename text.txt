I want to be here today because this time is truly precious. Everyone is struggling for something, but sometimes we forget why we're doing it. I want to be here with you. Maybe this path won't be easy, but together, anything is possible.

I want to talk to you because you understand me. I always wanted to explain things, but no one understood me. Then I said, "Maybe I should forge my own path." But then I thought, you're here. Everything is more beautiful, more meaningful with you. No matter what happens, don't go. Stay here, now, and always.

We don't know what will happen tomorrow. But we're here today, and that's precious. Sometimes it's exhausting to waver between being and not being. But I've made my decision. I want to be with you. Because this life isn't just about waiting. You have to take a step right now, right?

Everyone is searching for something anyway. But I think the important thing is knowing what you're looking for. If you feel the same way I do, things have to change. There might be some fear, maybe we won't be very brave. But together, we can achieve anything.

Now think: You were once alone, and now you have someone by your side. That alone makes it all worth it. Sometimes, just one word is enough. "Okay," "maybe," "yes," or just a simple "I." Then it's not so strange to want to be with you.

I'm here right now, and I say, "Come, let's go together." Today, tomorrow, maybe forever. Because I understand you, and you understand me. Isn't that enough?
